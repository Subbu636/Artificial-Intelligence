## Solving complex problems using AI
1. Explored different algorithms both schocastic(Genetic, AntColonyOptimisations) and deterministic (Savings,Greedy,HillClimbing), and compared their results in solving TSP
2. Few bots is available at Desdemona/bots which explores different algorithms that work on game tree like min-max, alfa-beta, sss* and some RL concepts
